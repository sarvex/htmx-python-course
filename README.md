## Course Summary

**htmx** is one of the hottest properties ðŸ”¥ in web development today, and for good reason. This framework, along with the libraries and techniques introduced in this course, will have you writing the best Python web apps you've ever written: clean, fast, and interactive without all that frontend overhead.

If you are a Python web developer that has wanted to build more dynamic, interactive apps, but just don't want to (or can't) write a significant portion of your app in a rich frontend JavaScript framework, **you'll absolutely love htmx**. This library lets you write Python code you love and still add that client-side interactive aspect.


## What's this course about and how is it different?

**htmx** is a very compelling technology. It's one of the first legitimate libraries that delivers on the promise of dynamic, interactive web applications without complex JavaScript. **htmx allows us to write server-side code in any language** (Python in our case) and, through a few simple HTML attributes, bring our pages to life.

This is the only course (that we're aware of) that shows you the full lifecycle of building Python and Flask-based applications centered around **htmx**. Unlike basic tutorials where you'll find only just quick coverage of a simple feature, we take a full-fledged web app and extend it by adding three real-world features all building upon **htmx**.

**Moreover, we show you the right way to use htmx with Flask and Python**. The resulting code is incredibly clean and would impress almost any professional web developer.


## What topics are covered

In this course, you will:

- **See how htmx differs** from common JavaScript front-end frameworks such as Vue and React.
- **Understand the server-side exchange** enabled by htmx attributes (e.g. `hx-trigger`).
- Add **click to edit** to an existing data-driven Flask application.
- **Learn about the `jinja-partials` package** to refactor our jinja2 templates (with or without htmx).
- **Add deep linking to our dynamic web application**, allowing us to share links into interactive segments.
- Add **active search** to an existing data-driven Flask application.
- **Implement browser history for htmx actions** (allowing back and forth navigation).
- Add **infinite scroll** to our app.
- **Distinguish between full page requests and partial htmx requests** within a single view method in Flask.
- And lots more
